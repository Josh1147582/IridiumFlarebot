The Iridium constellation with 66 active telecommunication 
satellites in low Earth orbit are known to cause the brightest 
flares of all orbiting satellites.
The Iridium communication satellites have a peculiar shape with 
three polished door-sized antennas, 120° apart and at 40° angles 
with the main bus. The forward antenna faces the direction 
the satellite is travelling.

IRIDIUM_STRING2 = ("""
Occasionally, an antenna reflects sunlight directly down at Earth, 
creating a predictable and quickly moving illuminated spot on the 
surface below of about 10 km (6.2 mi) diameter. To an observer 
this looks like a bright flash, or flare in the sky, with a 
duration of a few seconds.
